SWMM5 Example
-----

This example is borrowed from [https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/pyswmm/tree/master/example](https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/pyswmm/tree/master/example)

To use the sample file execute this command:
	
	swmm5 parkinglot.inp parkinglot.rpt parkinglot.out

You will then have the two new output files, `parkinglot.rpt` and `parkinglot.out`.
